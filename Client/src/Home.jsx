            Driven by technology disruptions and a raging pandemic, global
            majors in the hi-tech industry are looking to scale and outcompete
            rivals by outsourcing critical pieces of development work to
            innovative design services partners. Large design services companies
            are unable to build a high quality pool of resources with specialized
            skills due to their large overheads and previous generation financial
            models. As a result, they can only subcontract and act as a distribution
            channel for niche, specialized smaller firms such as P2F that have built
            enduring supply chains at the right cost.
